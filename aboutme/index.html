    <h2>Brevin Lay</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! I am very excited to be a part of this class for this semester. I am currently 
    majoring in Computer Information Technology and I am excited to learn more about the front end of websites.</p>
    <p>I currently live in Washington state with my family while I work on my degree and job.
    Before now I was serving a mission in the Florida Orland mission. I loved it there and it was an amazing 
    experience. When I am not doing those two things I am spending time on the computer, playing/practices/teaching 
    piano, and playing sports.(specifically volleyball and golf)</p>
    <p>I am taking this course to give a better understanding of the front end of websites so I can better utilize 
    the backend programming in a way that will be the most effective. I am excited to see where this takes me.</p>
